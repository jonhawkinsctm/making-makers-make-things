# Linked List vs Array ðŸ¥Š

This exercise will demonstrate the differences and trade offs between linked lists and arrays as data structures.

## What to do?

Within this directory you'll find two folders: "array" and "linked-list". Each folder contains a `.spec.js`, a `problem.js`, and also a `solution.js` file.

**Don't look at the solution.js file, unless you've got really stuck and no-one can help you!!!**

Your task is to open the `problem.js` file for each an implement the class as defined in the test.

You'll notice that both `MyArray` and `LinkedList` implement the same methods (or interface), but the code you have to write will be different for each.

To run the tests:

```sh
# Get the dependencies installed if you haven't
npm install

# Test your `MyArray` implementation
npm run test -- linked-list-vs-array/array

# Test your `LinkedList` implementation
npm run test -- linked-list-vs-array/linked-list
```
